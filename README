conlog is a simple logger, inspired by "script". It differs from "script" by
not using ptys (so it doesn't work with programs that expect a tty, e.g., an
interactive shell).

It differs from "tee" by keeping standard output and error separate (but
logging to the same file), and by optionally cutting off logs that get too
long.

Usage:

conlog [-o bytes[k|M]] logfile command ...

If the command contains options, add a "--" argument before the command, to
prevent conlog from trying to parse these options itself.
